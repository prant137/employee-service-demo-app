ABOUT THE PROJECT:
This is a springboot application exposing a rest service to do crud operations on Employee entity. The project uses a H2 in memory
database and maven for build and dependency management

Employee entity has 5 attributes -
e.g -
"id": "10001",
"name": "Prant",
"role": "Developer",
"team": "Avengers",
"company": "Fidelity"
